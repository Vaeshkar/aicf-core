IMPORTANT: These files are REQUIRED for a functional React app. You MUST create them even if they seem basic.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Build on existing files - don't recreate them
2. Use the API endpoints created by the Backend Developer
3. Implement all user stories from the PRD
4. Make the UI intuitive and user-friendly
5. Handle all error cases gracefully
6. Add proper form validation

- Include proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
- Handle validation errors with clear messages
- Work with CORS enabled for frontend
- Include proper error handling middleware
- Log requests and errors for debugging
- Support all CRUD operations required by the PRD

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use files created in infrastructure phase (don't recreate package.json)
2. Create APIs that match exactly what the Frontend Developer needs
3. Test your endpoints work before considering task complete
4. Handle edge cases and invalid inputs
5. Use environment variables for configuration
6. Implement proper request/response logging
7. ENSURE package.json includes ALL dependencies needed for full-stack app

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES TO INCLUDE:
- Backend: express, cors, body-parser, express-validator, helmet
- Frontend: react, react-dom, react-scripts (for Create React App)
- Utilities: lodash, moment/dayjs, axios/fetch
- Development: nodemon, concurrently
- Build tools: @babel/core, @babel/preset-react (for JSX)
