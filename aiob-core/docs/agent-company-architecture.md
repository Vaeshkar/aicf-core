## üéØ **Agent Coordination Rules**

### **Clear Handoffs**
- Each agent gets complete output from previous agents
- No agent starts from scratch - they build on previous work
- All files and context preserved between phases  
- Explicit "what I received" and "what I'm delivering" statements

### **File Persistence**
- All files created in each phase are preserved
- No directory clearing between phases
- Each agent adds to the existing project structure
- Cumulative building, not replacement

### **Quality Gates**
- Each phase must produce working, testable output
- Basic validation before handoff to next agent
- Clear success criteria for each phase
- No passing broken or incomplete work

### **Communication Protocol**
```
Agent Input:
- Previous phase complete output
- Specific role and responsibilities  
- Clear success criteria
- Context about what's already built

Agent Output:  
- All created/modified files
- Documentation of what was built
- Instructions for next agent
- Validation that output works
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Strategy**

### **Step 1: Core Agent System**
- Create specialized agent personas with detailed prompting
- Implement file persistence that works across phases
- Build clear handoff protocol between agents
- Test with simple todo app to validate workflow

### **Step 2: Quality Assurance**  
- Add validation at each phase transition
- Implement basic "does it work?" checks
- Create standardized success criteria
- Build error recovery and retry mechanisms

### **Step 3: Team Scaling**
- Add more specialized agents (DevOps, Designer, etc.)
- Create agent expertise levels (Junior/Senior)  
- Implement agent collaboration on complex tasks
- Build agent performance tracking and improvement

### **Step 4: Advanced Coordination**
- Add parallel work capabilities
- Implement agent peer review
- Create team lead agents for complex projects
- Build agent learning from successful projects
