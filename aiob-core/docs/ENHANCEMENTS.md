# AIOB Enhancements Roadmap

## Current Build Success âœ…
- **Files Created:** 19
- **Phases Completed:** 4
- **Tokens Used:** 18,972 (~$0.05)
- **AI Collaboration:** Claude â†’ GPT handoffs working
- **OpenRouter:** Successfully integrated

## Issues to Fix ðŸ”§

### 1. Duplicate Structure Problem
Multiple AIs created overlapping directories:
- backend/ AND apps/api/
- frontend/ AND apps/web/
- server.js at root AND in backend/
- routes/ at root AND in backend/

**Fix:** Add structure validation between phases

### 2. JSON Validation
Error: "Unexpected token p in JSON at position 0"
**Fix:** Validate all JSON before writing files

### 3. Weak QA Phase
Phase 4 doesn't actually test files
**Fix:** Add real validation (syntax, deps, imports)
