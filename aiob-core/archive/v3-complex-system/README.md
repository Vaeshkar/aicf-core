# AIOB v3 Complex System Archive

This folder contains the over-engineered components we built:

## What's Archived:
- Complex model selection logic (cost optimization)
- Phase validation agents (blocking validation)
- Debug iteration loops (5+ iterations)
- IntelligentFileManager (complex diff analysis)
- Multi-model task optimization
- Complex error analysis

## Why Archived:
- Over-engineered for simple use cases
- Lost focus on core AIOB vision
- Working v1 was simpler and more effective
