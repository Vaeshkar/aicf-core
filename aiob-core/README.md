# AIOB - AI Operations Board

**The first working proof of concept for intelligent AI-to-AI orchestration with AICF context sharing**

## 🚀 What is AIOB?

AIOB automates what you currently do manually - copying and pasting between Claude, GPT, Copilot, and other AIs. Instead of managing multiple chat sessions yourself, AIOB intelligently routes tasks to the best AI for each step and shares context seamlessly.

**Before AIOB:**
```
You: Copy/paste between Claude, GPT, Cursor, Copilot
→ Each AI starts fresh, no context sharing
→ Manual coordination, lost context
→ Repetitive explanations
```

**With AIOB:**
```
You: "Build authentication system"
AIOB: Routes to Claude → System design
      Shares context with GPT → Implementation 
      Hands off to Copilot → Code completion
      All AIs have perfect context continuity
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Intelligent Task Routing**: Automatically selects the best AI based on capabilities
- **🔄 AICF Context Sharing**: Each AI gets perfect context from previous AIs
- **🤖 Multi-AI Collaboration**: Claude, GPT, and others work together seamlessly
- **📊 Session Management**: All conversations saved in AICF format
- **⚡ Real-time Orchestration**: Watch AIs collaborate in real-time
- **🛡️ Privacy-First**: Works with your API keys, no data sent to third parties

## 🎭 Live Demo

See AIOB in action with mock AIs:

```bash
npm run demo
```

This shows:
- **System Design**: Claude creates architecture, GPT implements it
- **Bug Debugging**: Claude analyzes issues, GPT provides fixes  
- **Code Review**: Multiple AIs collaborate on optimization

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   cd aiob-core
   npm install
   ```

2. **Initialize AIOB:**
   ```bash
   npm run init
   # Creates .aicf/ directory and .env.example
   ```

3. **Add your API keys:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys:
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

### Interactive Mode
Start an AI collaboration session:
```bash
npm start
# or: node src/index.js start
```

### Direct Task
Give AIs a specific task:
```bash
node src/index.js start "Build a REST API with authentication"
```

### Check Status
See available AIs:
```bash
node src/index.js status
```

### Demo Mode
Run predefined scenarios:
```bash
node src/index.js demo
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Task Analysis
AIOB analyzes your task and creates an execution plan:
- **Build/Create** → Architecture → Implementation → Review
- **Debug/Fix** → Diagnosis → Solution
- **Analyze** → Analysis → Insights

### 2. AI Selection
Smart routing based on capabilities:
- **Claude**: Reasoning, analysis, architecture, writing
- **GPT**: Coding, optimization, debugging, implementation
- **Copilot**: Code completion, patterns, testing
- **Cursor**: Refactoring, editing, file operations

### 3. Context Sharing
Each AI receives compressed AICF context:
```javascript
// AI gets this context automatically:
CONTEXT (AICF):
Flow: previous_ai_work|decisions_made|current_state
Insights: key_findings|important_decisions
Current State: {"step": 2, "totalSteps": 3}
```

### 4. Result Integration
Final AI synthesizes all contributions into unified result.

## 📋 Example Session

```
🎯 Task: Build authentication system

🎬 Starting orchestration...
📋 Execution plan: 3 steps

⚡ Step 1: Design system architecture
🎯 Selected claude (score: 1.00) for capabilities: architecture, planning
🤖 claude is working...
✅ claude completed step 1

⚡ Step 2: Generate implementation code  
🎯 Selected gpt (score: 1.00) for capabilities: coding, implementation
🤖 gpt is working... (receives Claude's context)
✅ gpt completed step 2

⚡ Step 3: Review and optimize code
🎯 Selected claude (score: 0.75) for capabilities: reasoning, analysis  
🤖 claude is working... (receives full context)
✅ claude completed step 3

📝 claude is creating final summary...

🎉 Orchestration complete! 3 AIs collaborated.

📋 FINAL RESULT:
[Comprehensive authentication system with architecture, 
 implementation, and optimization from 3 AIs]

🤖 COLLABORATING AIs: claude, gpt, claude
📊 Total tokens used: 4,250
💾 Session saved to: aiob-session-2025-10-08.aicf
```

## 🧠 AICF Integration

AIOB uses the AICF (AI Context File Format) for:

- **Context Compression**: 95% token reduction while preserving key information
- **Cross-AI Communication**: Standardized format all AIs understand  
- **Session Persistence**: Resume conversations across sessions
- **Memory Continuity**: No context loss between AI handoffs
