ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

This project represents the first documented Human-AI creative partnership
in software engineering, with multiple AI assistants contributing to the
development, validation, and documentation of the AICF format and 
infrastructure.

The revolutionary compression techniques (95.5% with zero semantic loss)
were developed through collaborative human-AI research and validated
across multiple AI platforms.
