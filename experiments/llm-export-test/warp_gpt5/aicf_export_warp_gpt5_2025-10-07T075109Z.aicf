[2025-10-07T07:39:33Z] user: Provided a detailed summary of prior multi-LLM AICF export experiments and asked about testing GPT-5 in Warp.
[2025-10-07T07:40:xxZ] assistant: Recommended testing GPT-5 in Warp; explained benefits and offered to prepare an optimized export prompt.
[2025-10-07T07:42:13Z] user: Instructed export of current conversation to experiments/llm-export-test/warp_gpt5; included environment context.
[2025-10-07T07:42:20Z] assistant: Confirmed plan to create directory and write AICF file.
[2025-10-07T07:46:xxZ] assistant: Created directory and wrote AICF XML export file.
[2025-10-07T07:47:29Z] user: Noted switching from GPT-5 high reasoning to low reasoning due to 165s thinking time.
[2025-10-07T07:48:09Z] user: Asked to look at files in warp_gpt folder.
[2025-10-07T07:48:40Z] assistant: Listed folders and compared formats between Claude (sectioned) and GPT-5 (XML).
[2025-10-07T07:49:37Z] user: Said will run another test.
[2025-10-07T07:51:09Z] user: Requested second export and to mirror .aicf/conversation-memory.aicf style.

@INSIGHTS
- Interface constant, model variable: Claude used @SECTION pipe style while GPT-5 used XML; this test aligns GPT-5 output to house style to evaluate interface-agnostic standardization potential.
- Reasoning mode affects latency significantly; low reasoning preferable for deterministic export tasks.
@INSIGHTS_END

@DECISIONS
- Create a second export in warp_gpt5 using house @SECTION style for comparability with existing .aicf files.
- Preserve concise message summaries, not verbatim, to be consistent with prior AICF artifacts.
