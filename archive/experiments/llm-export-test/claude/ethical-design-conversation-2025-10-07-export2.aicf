  "content": "AICF Ethical Design Discussion - LLM Self-Reporting Approach\n\nCore Challenge: How to extract AI context from applications (Warp, Augment, etc.) stored in ~/Library/Application Support/ without violating user privacy or requiring invasive system permissions.\n\nSolution Discovery: Instead of system-level extraction requiring Full Disk Access, implement user-initiated LLM export where users explicitly request conversation export in AICF format. This consent-based 'pull' model replaces surveillance-based 'push' extraction.\n\nKey Outcomes:\n- Established 5 ethical principles for AICF\n- Created comprehensive AICF Ethical Design Guide (389 lines)\n- Designed AICF v3.0 format specification with @tagged sections\n- Implemented parser examples (TypeScript/Python)\n- Built CLI tool architecture\n- Documented GDPR/CCPA compliance pathway\n- Validated LLM export approach with this conversation\n\nParadigm Shift: Privacy-first design achieved by inverting data collection model from 'take without asking' to 'give when requested'.",
