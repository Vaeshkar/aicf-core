  "content": "AICF Ethical Design - LLM Export Approach Development Session\n\nUser Challenge: Building AICF extraction tool that needs to access application data in ~/Library/Application Support/ raised critical ethical and privacy concerns.\n\nProblem: System-level data extraction is invasive, requires privileged permissions (Full Disk Access), violates user privacy, and breaks when applications update their storage formats.\n\nBreakthrough Solution: User-initiated LLM self-reporting approach where users explicitly request 'Export conversation in AICF format' instead of system snooping. This transforms the model from surveillance-based push to consent-based pull.\n\nKey Principles Established:\n1. Explicit user consent (no automatic extraction)\n2. No system permissions required\n3. Platform-agnostic (works with any LLM)\n4. Local processing only\n5. Transparent human-readable format\n\nDeliverables: Complete AICF Ethical Design Guide (comprehensive 389-line markdown specification), format examples, parser implementations (TypeScript/Python), CLI tool design, privacy framework, GDPR/CCPA compliance guidelines.\n\nImpact: Solved fundamental ethical dilemma in AI context sharing by inverting the data collection model from 'take' to 'give'.",
