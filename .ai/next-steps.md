## üéØ **CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES** (Phase 2)

### Enterprise-Grade Testing Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

- [ ] **Jest Testing Framework Setup**
  - Comprehensive unit tests for all core components (aicf-api, reader, writer)
  - Round-trip tests (write ‚Üí read ‚Üí validate) with real AICF data
  - Negative tests for malformed, truncated, and corrupted files
  - Cross-version compatibility tests (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0)
  - Property-based testing for edge cases

- [ ] **CLI Tooling Implementation** ‚öíÔ∏è
  - **aicf-inspect** - View AICF structure, metadata, and semantic sections
  - **aicf-validate** - Compliance checking against AICF_SPEC_v3.0
  - **aicf-diff** - Compare two AICF files with semantic understanding  
  - **aicf-migrate** - Version upgrade/downgrade with data preservation

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking Suite** üìà
  - Automated benchmark runs with fixed datasets
  - Compression ratio validation (maintain 95.5% target)
  - Memory usage profiling for large files (100MB+)
  - Performance regression detection in CI/CD

### Security & Privacy Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

- [ ] **PII Detection & Redaction System** üîê
  - Implement configurable sensitive field detection
  - Create redaction patterns for emails, phones, SSNs, API keys
  - Add safe defaults excluding secrets from serialization
  - Build optional encryption wrapper for sensitive content

- [ ] **Error Handling & Corruption Resilience** üõ†Ô∏è
  - Graceful handling of truncated and corrupted files
  - Detection and recovery from partial corruption
  - Clear error messages with actionable guidance
  - Fallback mechanisms for unsupported versions

---

## üåç **Enterprise Integration Ecosystem** (Phase 3)

### Multi-Language Support

- [ ] **Python Wrapper Development**
  - Complete Python bindings for aicf-core
  - PyPI package publication
  - Integration examples with popular AI frameworks

- [ ] **TypeScript Definitions**
  - Complete type definitions for all APIs
  - IntelliSense support for IDEs
  - Example TypeScript integration projects

### Platform Integration Examples

- [ ] **LangChain Memory Provider**
  - Build AICF-based memory provider for LangChain
  - Demonstrate conversation persistence across sessions
  - Performance comparison with existing providers

- [ ] **OpenAI API Compatibility Layer**
  - Standard interface wrappers for OpenAI applications
  - Seamless drop-in replacement for existing memory systems
  - Migration tools from OpenAI conversation formats

---

## üéØ Long-term (This Quarter)

- [ ] Additional templates (Rust, API, Mobile)
- [ ] VS Code extension (optional)
- [ ] Advanced search with filters
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] AI-powered summarization with API integration

---

## üí° Ideas / Backlog

- Make "popular models" list configurable
- Add `npx aic doctor` command for health checks
- Add `npx aic diff` to compare knowledge base versions
- Add support for custom AI models (local LLMs)
- Add `npx aic backup` and `npx aic restore` commands
- Integration with more AI tools (Windsurf, Zed, etc.)
- Add telemetry (opt-in) to understand usage patterns
- Create video tutorials for common workflows
- Add `npx aic migrate` for upgrading old knowledge bases
