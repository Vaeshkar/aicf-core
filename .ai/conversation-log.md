## Chat warp-enhance - 2025-10-06 - Architecture Session

### Context & Objective
**Project**: /Users/leeuwen/Programming/aicf-core
**Platform**: Warp Terminal
**Focus**: Working on aicf-core project
**Objective**: System architecture design and data flow planning

### Work Accomplished
- âœ… **creation**: WarpParser for SQLite extraction and AugmentParser for LevelDB parsing
- âœ… **creation**: UniversalExtractor
- âœ… **modification**: Enhanced pattern recognition to extract specific work accomplished, decisions with rationale, and problems wi

### Problems Solved
#### Previous system caused data loss when Augment extraction broke both LLM streams
- **Solution**: Independent parser architecture with bulletproof backups
- **Evidence**: Problem: Previous system caused data loss when Augment extraction broke both LLM streams

Solution: Independent parser architecture with bulletproof backups...


### Key Decisions Made
- No significant decisions documented in this session

### Technical Implementation
**Files Modified/Referenced**:
- `/src/generators/EnhancedMarkdownGenerator.js` - ext-steps generation Created: /src/generators/EnhancedMarkdownGenerator.js Features: Context-aware sessi
- `UniversalExtractor.js` - s-all. Implementation: Built UniversalExtractor.js with createBackup() method, W
- `test-full-pipeline.js` - help very well. Command: node test-full-pipeline.js Output: ðŸ“Š Testing WARP Conve
- `EnhancedMarkdownGenerator.js` - tion Created: /src/generators/EnhancedMarkdownGenerator.js Features: Context-aware sessi

### Learning Outcomes
- ðŸ§  Discovered that Augment data actually contains substantial conversation content with Claude responses, not just metadata as initially assessed

### Next Steps & Follow-up
- Implement the designed architecture components
- Test integration between system components
- Review code changes and consider refactoring opportunities
- Run comprehensive tests on modified functionality
