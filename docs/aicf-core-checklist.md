# AICF-Core Development Checklist & Roadmap

## 1. Baseline Features for an "AICF‑Core" Repo

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Component               Purpose                 Key considerations
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  **AICF spec document**  The authoritative       Must be
  (`AICF_SPEC.md`,        format spec, fields,    human‑readable +
  versioned)              encodings, versioning   machine‑verifiable;
                          rules                   clearly document
                                                  backward/forward
                                                  compatibility, version
                                                  tags, optional vs
                                                  required fields.

  **Writer / Serializer** Given a memory          Support multiple
                          representation, produce encoding options
                          a valid AICF file /     (e.g. JSON, compressed
                          byte stream             / binary, fallback
                                                  plain).

  **Reader / Parser /     Read AICF files,        Validate version,
  Deserializer**          validate integrity,     detect corruption,
                          produce memory          handle optional fields,
                          structures              errors gracefully.

  **Tests / Fuzzing /     Ensure writer + reader  Unit tests, property
  Validation**            roundtrip correctness,  tests, negative tests
                          edge cases, corrupt     (malformed input),
                          files                   cross-version
                                                  compatibility tests.

  **Benchmarks /          Measure time, memory,   Use fixed data sets;
  Performance suite**     compression ratio, etc. produce reproducible
                                                  metrics; publish
                                                  artifacts.

  **Examples /            Show real-world usage   Minimal working code in
  Integrations**          (e.g. integrate with    Python, JS, or more
                          context engine, openai, languages.
                          embedding store)        

  **Adapters / Bindings   If core is in one       Ensure boundary safety,
  (optional)**            language, expose        version sync.
                          bindings (e.g. a Python 
                          wrapper of a Rust core) 

  **CLI or helper tools** Validate / inspect /    Useful for debugging
                          diff AICF files,        and migration.
                          migration tools         

  **Versioning &          Ability to migrate from Provide automatic
  Migration utilities**   AICF v1 → v2, detect    migration logic or
                          older versions          tools.

  **Documentation &       README, CHANGELOG,      Must be clear so
  reference**             usage patterns,         external users can
                          tradeoffs, error codes  adopt safely.

  **Security / privacy    Guidelines for          Document how to avoid
  considerations**        embedding sensitive     leaking PII / secrets.
                          content, encryption,    
                          redaction               

  **License /             Clear licensing, CLA if Encourages community.
  contribution            needed, contributor     
  guidelines**            code of conduct

## 2. Risks & Pitfalls

-   **Spec drift** --- implementation diverges from the spec doc over
    time.\
-   **Backward/forward compatibility breakage** --- changes in field
    definitions, compression logic, or required fields can break
    existing stored contexts.\
-   **Silent data loss** --- if summarization, filtering, or truncation
    logic is too aggressive, important context might be lost.\
-   **Performance regressions** --- as features are added, performance
    might degrade (esp. on large histories).\
-   **Interoperability problems** --- users in different languages or
    platforms might interpret formats differently.\
-   **Corruption handling** --- AICF files might be truncated, partially
    overwritten, or corrupted in transit; parser should fail safely.\
-   **Security leakage** --- users might accidentally embed secrets in
    AICF; or read memory from other sessions.\
-   **Version sprawl** --- many minor versions without clear migration
    path.\
-   **Complexity creep** --- core becoming too big, mixing optimization,
    logic, UI, etc.

    required\
-   [ ] Versioning plan (e.g. `v1.0.0` with semantic versioning)\
-   [ ] Examples of minimal & full AICF files (in JSON / binary)

### Core Implementation

-   [ ] Writer / serializer that produces valid output matching spec\
-   [ ] Reader / parser that can validate & recover structures\
-   [ ] Round-trip tests (write → read → compare)

### Testing

-   [ ] Performance tests & benchmarks

### Migration & Version Tools

-   [ ] `aicf-diff` (compare two AICF files, changes)\
-   [ ] `aicf-validate` (check compliance)

### Documentation & Examples

-   [ ] README with usage guide\
-   [ ] Code examples (ideally in multiple languages or languages your
    users will use)\
-   [ ] FAQ / "gotchas" (e.g. embedding limits, missing fields)

### Security / Privacy

-   [ ] Guidelines on how to manage PII / secrets in stored contexts\
-   [ ] Optionally, encryption or secure wrapping (if needed)\
-   [ ] Safe defaults (e.g. default exclude secrets, redact sensitive
    keys)

### Release Infrastructure / CI

-   [ ] Automated tests on PRs\
-   [ ] Lint / static analysis\
-   [ ] Benchmark runs\
-   [ ] Tagging & release pipelines (npm / PyPI / etc)

### Governance & Community

-   [ ] LICENSE file\
-   [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md & Code of Conduct\
-   [ ] Issue templates / PR templates

### Stability & Deprecation Plan

-   [ ] Backwards-compatibility guarantees\
-   [ ] Deprecation warnings & migration path for breaking changes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Suggestions for Collaboration / Adoption

-   **Language bindings early**: JS + Python at minimum; maybe Rust or
    Go for performance layers.\
-   **Community workshop / tutorial**: show how to adopt AICF in an
    existing AI chat stack.\
-   **Validation library**: a small "schema validator" to help other
    implementers.\
-   **Version compatibility matrix**: e.g. "clients v1.0 ↔ core v1.0
    support reading v0.x files (with warnings)."\
-   **Benchmark publish**: as releases go out, publish performance
    metrics to build trust.\
-   **Reference implementation**: make sure your core is not too
    opinionated but is solid enough to serve as a baseline.\
-   **Partner / adopter case studies**: show how others used AICF-Core
    --- to build legitimacy.
