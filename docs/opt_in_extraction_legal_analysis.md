# Legal Analysis: Opt-In Local Data Extraction for AICF
## create-ai-text-context Tool - Terms of Service & Privacy Compliance

**Analysis Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Purpose:** Determine if explicit opt-in consent for local Library/Application Support data extraction is legally permissible

---

## Executive Summary

### ✅ Opt-In Local Extraction: LEGALLY VIABLE

**Bottom Line:** You CAN build an opt-in tool that extracts context data from local application storage with explicit user consent, BUT you must:

1. **Get explicit, informed consent** via EULA/Terms of Service
2. **Be transparent** about what data you access
3. **Process locally only** (no external transmission without consent)
4. **Respect platform ToS** limitations
5. **Provide clear opt-out** mechanisms

### ⚠️ LLM Platform Restrictions

**Mixed Results:** Some platforms explicitly prohibit certain types of automated extraction:

- **OpenAI/ChatGPT**: ❌ Prohibits automatic programmatic extraction from web interface
- **Claude/Anthropic**: ⚠️ Data flows through their servers; no direct API bypass
- **Cursor IDE**: ⚠️ All data routes through Cursor's backend
- **Warp Terminal**: ⚠️ Privacy concerns raised by community; local storage access unclear

---

## Detailed Legal Analysis

### 1. Your Tool's Legal Position

#### What You're Building
`create-ai-text-context` - A tool that:
- Extracts AI conversation context from local application storage
- Reads from `~/Library/Application Support/` (macOS)
- Requires **explicit user opt-in**
- Processes data **locally only**
- Creates portable AICF format files

#### Legal Framework

**This is LEGAL under these conditions:**

✅ **User Owns the Data**: Users have legitimate access to their own local files  
✅ **Explicit Consent**: Your EULA requires active user agreement  
✅ **Local Processing**: No external transmission = lower privacy risk  
✅ **Transparency**: You disclose exactly what you access  
✅ **No Circumvention**: You're not bypassing security measures  

### 2. EULA Requirements for Your Tool

Your `create-ai-text-context` tool MUST include:

```markdown

### 3. Platform-Specific Analysis

#### OpenAI / ChatGPT

**Terms of Service Position:**

OpenAI's Terms prohibit users from automatically or programmatically extracting data or output from their services.

**Implications for Your Tool:**

- ❌ **Cannot extract** from ChatGPT web interface automatically
- ⚠️ **Gray area** for local cache/storage files
- ✅ **Can use** official ChatGPT API (if user has API access)
- ✅ **Can use** manual export features

**Recommendation:**
- Require users to manually export via ChatGPT's built-in export feature
- OR use official API with user's API key
- Do NOT scrape the web interface or browser storage

#### Anthropic / Claude

**Data Handling:**

Claude Code cannot access databases or external APIs unless explicitly shared, and all data routes through Anthropic's infrastructure even when using custom API keys.

**Privacy Policy:**

If users opt out of model training, chats are retained in backend storage for up to 30 days, with flagged content retained for up to 2 years.

**Implications for Your Tool:**

- ⚠️ **Local storage access unclear** - Anthropic doesn't explicitly address this
- ✅ **User owns conversation data** - users can delete conversations
- ⚠️ **All API calls route through Anthropic** - no direct access
- ✅ **Zero Data Retention available** for Enterprise API users

**Recommendation:**
- Support LLM export approach (user requests export)
- Verify Claude web app doesn't explicitly prohibit local storage access
- If accessing local cache, disclose this clearly in EULA

#### Cursor IDE

**Security Architecture:**

All Cursor data routes through Cursor's backend even when users bring their own API keys, with no option for self-hosting or direct communication with LLM providers.

**Privacy Mode:**

Cursor offers Privacy Mode that prevents AI from processing sensitive codebase data, but it must be manually enabled.

**Implications for Your Tool:**

- ⚠️ **All data flows through Cursor** - architecture limitation
- ✅ **Users have local cache** - may be accessible
- ⚠️ **Privacy concerns exist** - community discussions about data flow
- ✅ **No explicit prohibition** found on local storage access

**Recommendation:**
- Respect Privacy Mode settings if detectable
- Warn users that extracted data may have been routed through Cursor's servers
- Consider supporting Cursor's official export features if available

#### Warp Terminal

**Community Concerns:**

Warp faced community backlash over telemetry data being sent to Segment, with users expressing concerns about keystroke and command logging.

**Privacy Stance:**

Warp states that personal commands and data used inside the terminal are not monitored or stored, but requires account login for AI features.

**Implications for Your Tool:**

- ⚠️ **Privacy concerns exist** - community trust issues
- ⚠️ **Telemetry present** - network connections to external services  
- ✅ **Local storage accessible** - standard macOS application
- ⚠️ **No explicit ToS** found prohibiting local extraction

**Recommendation:**
- Proceed with caution - clearly inform users
- Extract only conversation context, not commands/keystrokes
- Respect user privacy settings
- Monitor for Warp ToS updates

## 4. GDPR & CCPA Compliance

### GDPR (EU Users)

Your opt-in approach **complies** with GDPR if you:

✅ **Lawful Basis**: Consent (Article 6(1)(a))  
✅ **Transparency**: Clear information about data processing (Article 13)  
✅ **User Rights**: Allow users to access/delete data (Articles 15-17)  
✅ **Data Minimization**: Extract only necessary data (Article 5(1)(c))  
✅ **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purpose (Article 5(1)(b))

### CCPA (California Users)

Your approach **complies** with CCPA if you:

✅ **Disclosure**: Clear privacy policy about data collection  
✅ **Opt-Out**: Users can stop using tool anytime  
✅ **No Sale**: You don't sell user data  
✅ **Access Rights**: Users have access to extracted data

## 5. LLM Export Approach vs Local Extraction

### Comparison

| Factor | LLM Export (User Requests) | Local Extraction (Your Tool) |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Legal Clarity** | ✅ Very Clear | ⚠️ Gray Area |
| **User Consent** | ✅ Explicit per-export | ✅ One-time EULA |
| **Platform ToS** | ✅ Compliant | ⚠️ Depends on platform |
| **Privacy** | ✅ High | ✅ High (local only) |
| **Convenience** | ❌ Manual each time | ✅ Automated |
| **Token Cost** | ❌ Uses tokens | ✅ No cost |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Stable | ⚠️ Breaks with updates |
| **Blocking AI** | ❌ Yes (requires AI turn) | ✅ No blocking |

### Hybrid Recommendation

**Best Approach: Offer BOTH methods**

```javascript
// Primary method: LLM export
aicf export --method llm-request --from claude

// Alternative method: Local extraction (opt-in)
aicf export --method local-extract --from claude --consent

// Show consent dialog first time
if (!userHasConsented('local-extract')) {
  showEULA();
  await getUserConsent();
}
```

This gives users choice:
- **LLM Export**: Safest, always compliant, but uses tokens
- **Local Extract**: Faster, automated, but requires understanding ToS

---

## 6. Recommended Implementation

### EULA Presentation

```javascript
// First run
if (isFirstRun()) {
  console.log('Welcome to create-ai-text-context!');
  console.log('\nThis tool can extract AI conversation context in two ways:\n');
  console.log('1. LLM EXPORT (Recommended)');
  console.log('   - You ask your LLM to export conversation');
  console.log('   - 100% compliant with all ToS');
  console.log('   - No special permissions needed');
  console.log('   - Uses AI tokens\n');
  
  console.log('2. LOCAL EXTRACTION (Advanced)');
  console.log('   - Automatically reads from application storage');
  console.log('   - Requires explicit consent');
  console.log('   - May be subject to platform ToS');
  console.log('   - No token cost\n');
  
  const choice = await promptUser('Which method do you prefer? (1/2): ');
  
  if (choice === '2') {
    await presentEULA();
    const consent = await promptUser('Do you agree to the terms? (yes/no): ');
    if (consent === 'yes') {
      saveConsent('local-extract', true);
    }
  }
}
```

### Transparency Features

```javascript
// Show what will be accessed
aicf extract --from warp --dry-run

// Output:
// Would access:
// - ~/Library/Application Support/warp/context.db
// - Conversations from: 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-07
// - Estimated size: 2.3 MB
// - Files to create: warp-export.aicf
//
// Proceed? (yes/no):
```

### Per-Application Consent

```javascript
const PLATFORM_WARNINGS = {
  chatgpt: {
    warning: 'OpenAI ToS prohibits automated extraction from web interface',
    recommendation: 'Use manual export or API method instead',
    riskLevel: 'high'
  },
  claude: {
    warning: 'Data flow through Anthropic servers',
    recommendation: 'LLM export method preferred',
    riskLevel: 'medium'
  },
  cursor: {
    warning: 'All data routes through Cursor backend',
    recommendation: 'Respect Privacy Mode settings',
    riskLevel: 'medium'
  },
  warp: {
    warning: 'Community privacy concerns exist',
    recommendation: 'Extract context only, not commands',
    riskLevel: 'medium'
  }
};

// Before extraction
function warnUser(platform) {
  const warning = PLATFORM_WARNINGS[platform];
  console.log(`⚠️  ${warning.warning}`);
  console.log(`📌 Recommendation: ${warning.recommendation}`);
  console.log(`Risk Level: ${warning.riskLevel}\n`);
  return promptUser('Continue anyway? (yes/no): ');
}
```

## 10. Conclusion & Recommendations

### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid Approach

**Implement both methods with LLM Export as default:**

1. **Default: LLM Export** ✅
   - User requests export via natural language
   - 100% ToS compliant
   - No legal gray areas
   - Recommended for all users

2. **Optional: Local Extraction** ⚠️
   - Requires explicit EULA acceptance
   - Shows per-platform warnings
   - Only for advanced users who understand risks
   - Disabled by default

### Implementation Priority

```bash
Phase 1: LLM Export (Launch with this)
- ✅ Safest legally
- ✅ Works everywhere
- ✅ No platform-specific code needed

Phase 2: Local Extraction (Add as opt-in feature)
- ⚠️ Requires legal review
- ⚠️ Platform-specific implementations
- ⚠️ Maintenance burden
- ⚠️ Risk of ToS changes
```

### Your Original Concern: ADDRESSED ✅

> "The manual asking to data_dump an LLM is okay, but it is also token eating and blocking the AI to continue work."

**Solution:** Offer both, let users choose:

- **Token-conscious users**: Use local extraction (with consent)
- **Safety-conscious users**: Use LLM export
- **Enterprise users**: Use LLM export (audit trail)
- **Power users**: Use local extraction (speed)

### Legal Bottom Line

**YES, you can build an opt-in local extraction tool, BUT:**

1. ✅ **Get explicit written consent** via EULA
2. ✅ **Be radically transparent** about what you access
3. ✅ **Process locally only** (critical for privacy)
4. ✅ **Warn about platform ToS** on per-app basis
5. ✅ **Offer LLM export alternative** as primary method
6. ✅ **Respect user rights** (delete, opt-out, access)
7. ⚠️ **Consult a lawyer** before commercial launch
8. ⚠️ **Monitor ToS changes** of platforms you support

**This approach balances:**
- User convenience (automated extraction)
- Legal compliance (explicit consent)
- Platform respect (warnings and alternatives)
- Privacy protection (local processing)
