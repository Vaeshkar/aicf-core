# Claude VS Code Extension - Official API Integration Request

## Context

**Project:** AICF-Core (AI Context Format)
**Purpose:** Universal format for preserving AI conversation context across platforms
**Integration Target:** Claude-based VS Code extensions (Claude Dev, Claude Code, etc.)

We're building AICF-Core to help developers preserve valuable AI conversation context for reuse across sessions, tools, and team collaboration. We understand VS Code's extension sandboxing prevents direct integration with other extensions' chat UIs, and we want to explore official, supported integration pathways.

## Key Integration Questions for Claude Team

### 1. Extension API for Conversation Events

**Question:** Do you plan to expose any official APIs for extensions to detect conversation events?

**Why This Matters:**
- Enables third-party context management tools
- Allows ecosystem tools to add value without being intrusive
- Supports workflow automation and productivity enhancements

**Desired API Surface:**
```typescript
// Example desired API
interface ClaudeConversationAPI {
  // Event subscriptions
  onConversationStart(callback: (conversation: Conversation) => void): Disposable;
  onConversationEnd(callback: (conversation: Conversation) => void): Disposable;
  onMessageComplete(callback: (message: Message) => void): Disposable;

  // State queries
  getActiveConversation(): Conversation | null;
  getConversationHistory(): Conversation[];

  // Metadata access (with user consent)
  getConversationMetadata(conversationId: string): ConversationMetadata;
}
```

**Use Cases for AICF:**
- Export conversations at natural completion points
- Track conversation value metrics
- Link conversations to code changes
- Build project-wide context graphs

---

### 2. Webhook/Event Support for Conversation Lifecycle

**Question:** Would you consider adding webhook/event support for conversation lifecycle (start/end/idle)?

**Proposed Events:**
- `conversation.started` - User initiates new conversation
- `conversation.ended` - Conversation explicitly closed or completed
- `conversation.idle` - No activity for configurable period (e.g., 5 minutes)
- `conversation.milestone` - Significant progress (problem solved, code committed)
- `message.sent` - User sends message
- `message.received` - Claude completes response

**Event Payload Example:**
```typescript
interface ConversationEvent {
  type: 'started' | 'ended' | 'idle' | 'milestone';
  timestamp: string;
  conversationId: string;
  metadata: {
    messageCount: number;
    duration: number;
    filesModified: string[];
    commandsExecuted: string[];
  };
}
```

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Events would be opt-in via user settings
- Payload contains only metadata, not message content
- User controls which extensions can subscribe
- Clear consent flow on first subscription

---

### 3. Post-Conversation Action Suggestions

**Question:** Is there any supported way for external extensions to suggest actions after conversations end?

**Current Challenge:**
Extensions cannot inject UI elements into Claude's chat interface due to sandboxing.

**Potential Solutions We'd Like to Explore:**

**Option A: Extension Contribution Points**
```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "claudeActions": [
      {
        "id": "aicf.exportConversation",
        "title": "Export in AICF Format",
        "icon": "$(archive)",
        "when": "conversationEnded && messageCount > 5"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Option B: Notification API**
```typescript
// Claude extension provides notification hook
claude.suggestAction({
  message: "Export this conversation in AICF format?",
  actions: [
    { label: "Export", command: "aicf.exportConversation" },
    { label: "Not now", action: "dismiss" }
  ],
  trigger: "conversation.ended"
});
```

**Option C: Status Bar Integration**
- Claude extension reserves status bar section for partner extensions
- AICF shows export suggestion in designated area
- User can click to export or dismiss

**Desired User Experience:**
- Non-intrusive suggestion appears at natural breakpoints
- Feels native to Claude interface
- Easy to accept (Tab+Enter) or dismiss
- Respects user preferences (don't show again, auto-export, etc.)

---

### 4. Conversation Data Storage Format

**Question:** Do you store conversation data in accessible formats that extensions could monitor (with user consent)?

**What We Need:**
- File path/location where conversations are stored
- Format specification (JSON, SQLite, proprietary?)
- Update mechanism (can we watch for changes?)
- Read access permissions model

**Current Investigation:**
We're planning to use VS Code's FileSystemWatcher to monitor conversation storage:

```typescript
// Hypothetical monitoring approach
const conversationWatcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher(
  '**/claude-conversations/**/*.{json,db}'
);

conversationWatcher.onDidChange(async (uri) => {
  // Request user permission first time
  const hasPermission = await requestConversationAccessPermission();

  if (hasPermission) {
    const conversation = await parseConversationFile(uri);
    await convertToAICF(conversation);
  }
});
```

**Privacy-First Approach:**
- Explicit user consent required
- Clear explanation of what data is accessed
- Option to auto-export without reading content (metadata only)
- User controls retention and sharing

**Questions:**
- Is filesystem monitoring acceptable, or would you prefer an API?
- Can you provide stable file format documentation?
- Are there plans to encrypt conversation storage?
- Would you support an export API instead?

---

### 5. Standardized Conversation Export Collaboration

**Question:** Would you be interested in collaborating on standardized conversation export features?

**Proposal: AICF as Standard Export Format**

AICF (AI Context Format) aims to be a universal, open standard for preserving AI conversations. We'd love to work with Anthropic to make AICF the default export format for Claude conversations.

**Benefits for Claude Users:**
- Preserve conversations for future reference
- Share context with team members
- Resume conversations in different tools
- Build searchable knowledge bases
- Track AI-assisted development over time

**Benefits for Anthropic:**
- Differentiate Claude with superior context management
- Enable enterprise features (compliance, audit trails)
- Foster ecosystem of context-aware tools
- Support research on AI-human collaboration

**Potential Collaboration Models:**

**Option 1: Built-in AICF Export**
- Native "Export Conversation" command in Claude
- Saves in AICF format to user-specified location
- Includes metadata, code changes, file references
- Option to auto-export on conversation end

**Option 2: Export API for Extensions**
```typescript
// Claude provides export API
const claudeAPI = await vscode.extensions.getExtension('anthropic.claude').activate();

claudeAPI.exportConversation({
  conversationId: 'abc123',
  format: 'aicf',
  includeMetadata: true,
  includeCodeChanges: true
}).then(aicfData => {
  // Extension handles storage/processing
});
```

**Option 3: Plugin Architecture**
- Claude supports export plugins
- AICF provides official plugin
- Other formats can be added by community
- User chooses default export format

**What We Can Offer:**
- Maintained AICF specification and tooling
- Reference implementations for parsing/generation
- Validation tools and format converters
- Documentation and developer support
- Open governance for format evolution

---

## Our Planned Approach (Without Official API)

While we await potential official integration, we're planning to implement:

### Phase 1: Non-Intrusive Monitoring
- VS Code notifications suggesting AICF export
- File system monitoring (with explicit user consent)
- Command palette integration
- Status bar indicators

### Phase 2: Heuristic Detection
- Analyze user activity patterns
- Detect natural conversation boundaries
- Estimate conversation value
- Trigger suggestions at appropriate times

### Phase 3: Manual Export Flow
- User manually triggers export via command
- Extension parses accessible conversation data
- Converts to AICF format
- Saves to project `.aicf/` directory

**User Experience:**
```
[User finishes productive Claude conversation]

[VS Code notification appears]
"ðŸ’¬ Save this Claude conversation in AICF format?"
[Export] [Not now] [Don't ask again]

[If user clicks Export]
âœ“ Conversation exported to .aicf/conversations/
âœ“ Added to project context index
âœ“ Linked to code changes in commit abc123
```

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements
- Smart conversation value scoring
- Automatic tagging and categorization
- Cross-session context graphs
- Team collaboration features

## Appendix: User Stories

### Story 1: The Problem Solver
> "I spent 3 hours with Claude debugging a complex async issue. We tried 5 different approaches, and finally got it working. Two weeks later, I faced a similar issue in a different project, but I couldn't remember the solution details. I wish I could have easily saved that conversation and referenced it later."

**AICF Solution:** Export conversation, tag as "async-debugging", search and reference later.

### Story 2: The Team Lead
> "My junior developer had a great conversation with Claude about testing strategies. I wanted to share it with the whole team, but copy-pasting felt inadequateâ€”I needed the context, the code iterations, everything. Email threads don't capture the full problem-solving journey."

**AICF Solution:** Export conversation with full context, share AICF file with team, others can import and learn.

### Story 3: The Context Switcher
> "I work on 3 different projects daily. I have valuable Claude conversations in each project, but when I switch contexts, I lose all that accumulated knowledge. Each new conversation starts from zero, even when I solved similar problems before."

**AICF Solution:** Project-level AICF index links conversations to code. Claude (or other AIs) can reference past conversations automatically.

### Story 4: The Compliance Officer
> "Our company needs audit trails of AI-assisted code changes for compliance. Right now, we have git commits, but we lose the 'why' and the reasoning process. We need to preserve the conversation that led to each code change."

**AICF Solution:** Automatic export on commit, linked to git history, full audit trail of AI assistance.
