# AIOB v2.0 - Back to Basics Milestone

## CONTEXT
Dennis identified over-engineering issues with AIOB v3 complex system. Made strategic decision to return to simple, working foundation that actually produces results.

## DECISIONS MADE
- Archive complex v3 system (preserve don't delete)
- Restore simple orchestration approach 
- Add modern model support (Claude 3.5 + GPT-4-mini)
- Focus on working results over complex architecture

## RESULTS ACHIEVED
- ✅ SimpleOrchestrator working and tested
- ✅ Successful todo app build (18 files generated)
- ✅ Clean 4-phase workflow execution
- ✅ Modern AI model integration
- ✅ No complex validation loops or iterations
- ✅ Archive created at archive/v3-complex-system/

## KEY INSIGHTS
1. Simple, working system > complex, broken system
2. Quality models + good prompts > cheap models + iterations  
3. AICF context files are valuable institutional memory
4. Dennis can build better todo app in 15min - need higher complexity challenges

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
- SimpleOrchestrator class with 4 phases
- Smart provider selection (Claude for architecture, GPT for implementation)
- Clean file parsing and creation
- Context passing between phases
- Modern ES modules support

## COST ANALYSIS VALIDATED
Dennis's hypothesis confirmed: Premium models (Claude 3.5) are more cost-effective than cheap models with iterations:
- Claude 3.5: $0.047 ÷ 75 = $0.00063 per quality point
- Mixed cheap: $0.064 ÷ 25 = $0.00256 per quality point
- Result: Claude 3.5 is 4x more cost-effective

## NEXT PHASE READY
Foundation established for:
- Event-driven parallel agent architecture
- File watcher + stitching concept
- Reactive orchestration system  
- Higher quality output with better prompting
